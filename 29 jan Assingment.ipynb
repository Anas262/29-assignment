    "# Qus:1 Who developed python programing language ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:1  Python is developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1970.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:2  Which type of programing does support ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:2  Python is multiparadigm programing language.Object oriented programing and strutured \n",
    "# programing are fully supported. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:3  Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:3  Yes, Python is a case−sensitive programming language. This means that \n",
    "# it considers uppercase and lowercase letters differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:4  What is the correct extension of the Python file ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:4  (.py )is the correct extension of the Pyhon file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:5  Is python code compiled or interpreted ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:5  Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted \n",
    "# into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:6  Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:6  Structure of a program. A Python program is constructed from code blocks.\n",
    "# A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit.\n",
    "# The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:7  State a character used to give single-line comments in python ?\n",
    "# Ans:7  Comments in Python are identified with a hash symbol (#) and extend to the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:8  Mention function which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:8  The function sys. version can help us to find the version of python \n",
    "# that we are currently working on. It also contains information on the build number and compiler used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:9  Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:9  Python supports the creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) \n",
    "# at runtime, using a construct called lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:10  what does pip stand for python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:10  Developed in 2008, pip (an acronym of “pip Install Packages”) is today the standard tool for installing Python packages and \n",
    "# their dependencies in a secure manner.Most recent distributions of Python come with pip preinstalled. Python 2.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:11  Mention a few built-in functions in python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:11  print()         prints to the standarad output\n",
    "#         complex()       Return the complex number\n",
    "#         dict()          Return a dictionary\n",
    "#         len()           Return the length of object\n",
    "#         int()           Return the integer number\n",
    "#         float()         Return the float number\n",
    "#         str()           Return string object\n",
    "#         list()          Return a list\n",
    "#         range()\t        Returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 and increments by 1 (by default)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:12  What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:12  An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python.  \n",
    "# Python is one of the most popular programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus13:  What are the benefits of using python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:13  Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that \n",
    "# focuses on code readability.\n",
    "# It generally has small programs when compared to Java and C. \n",
    "# It was founded in 1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Presence of third-party modules \n",
    "# 2.Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics, etc.) \n",
    "# 3.Open source and large active community base \n",
    "# 4.Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write\n",
    "# 5.User-friendly data structures \n",
    "# 6.High-level language \n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:14  How is memory managed in python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:14  Memory management in Python involves the management of a private heap.A private heap is aportion of memory \n",
    "# that is exclusive to the Python process. All Python objects and data structures are stored in theprivate heap. \n",
    "# The operating system cannot allocate this piece of memory to another process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qus:15  How to add Python to Windows PATH?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:15  Python is a great language! However, it doesn’t come pre-installed with Windows.Hence we download it to\n",
    "# interpret the Python code which we write. But wait, windows don’t know where you have installed the Python so\n",
    "# when trying to any Python code, you will get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We will be using Windows10 and python3 for this article. (Most of the part is same for any\n",
    "# other version of either windows or python)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add Python to Windows Path\n",
    "# First, we need to locate where the python is being installed after downloading it.\n",
    "# Press WINDOWS key and search for “Python”, you will get something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add Python to Windows Path\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# If no results appear then Python is not installed on your machine, download it before proceeding further.\n",
    "# Click on open file location and you will be in a location where Python is installed, Copy the location path from the top by clicking over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add Python to Windows Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, we have to add the above-copied path as a variable so that windows can recognize. \n",
    "# Search for “Environmental Variables”, you will see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add Python to Windows Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# Click on that\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add Python to Windows Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now click the “Environmental Variables” button\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add Python to Windows Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# There will be two categories namely “User” and “System”, we have to add it in Users,\n",
    "# click on New button in the User section. Now, add a Variable Name and Path which we copied previously and \n",
    "# click OK. That’s it, DONE!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the Environment variable is set or not\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, after adding the Python to the Environment variable, let’s check if the Python is running anywhere in the \n",

    "# Qus:16  Is Indentation required in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:16  Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.\n",
    "# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only,\n",
    "# the indentation in Python is very important.\n",
    "# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n"
